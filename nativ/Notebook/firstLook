    part 2.2:
        Coding mistakes:
        1)malloc is supposed to be:
                malloc(sizeof(char)*LEN*times);
            The "sizeof" part is missing.
        2) out= out+ LEN increment should be after strcpy
        3)the return value should be the begining of the string
        4)assert should be "assert(s)" not "assert(!s)" to check if string isn't null

        Convention mistakes:
        1)for loop content should be indented
        2)LEN, variables should be small letters
        3)
        4)

        Not sure:
        1)assert(out)?
            you should not assert a malloc output,
            but is it a coding mistake or Convention?
        Doubt it:
        2)function name? should be named according to action,
            although, it might be part of a "string" ADT.. so..
        3)maybe a comment on out variable? but idk.. I doubt it.
        4)why isn't 0 times allowed? logicly this should just return an empty string.

part 3.1:
we are told to make a map, a dictionary.
I'm wondering what the struct better look like.
Should we use A data structure other than a simple array?
maybe a linked list? for the ease of sorting and expanding.
